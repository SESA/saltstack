These scripts will install, setup and run a memcached-mutilate experiment on a set
of nodes. 

Requirements: 
  
  You must set the appropriate roles to each nodes: 
    server: memcached server    
    master: mutilate master
    minion: mutilate minion
  
    > salt "*" grains.setval roles "minion"

  
  Trigger a mine update on all nodes:
    > salt '*' mine.flush
    > salt '*' mine.update


You must trigger a 'mine update' between running "setup" and "begin"
