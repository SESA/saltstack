These scripts will install, setup and run a memcached-mutilate experiment on a set
of nodes. 

  
 1) set the appropriate roles to each nodes: 
    memcached server = "memcached"
    mutilate master = "master"
    mutilate minion = "minion"
  
  e.g.:
    salt "*" grains.setval roles "minion"

  
Server and master state is read from the salt mine. You must trigger the nodes
to refresh:
    > salt '*' mine.flush
    > salt '*' mine.update
